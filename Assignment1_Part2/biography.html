        Hi, my name is Justin-Thomas Warkus-Fortin, and this a short biography. I was born and raised right here in
        Ottawa, Ontario.
        I was the first born and then 3 years later my brother was born. As my brother and I got older, my parents got
        married with my
        brother and I being a part of it. I grew up going to École élémentaire catholique Terre-des-Jeunes, an all
        french catholic school
        for all of my primary years. In seventh grade I decided to follow my science passion and enroll at a science
        oriented school program
        at College Catholique Samuel-Genest. Unfortunately long commutes were not fun, it got worse everyday. Therefore
        the year after,
        my parents agreed and changed me to College Catholique Franco-Ouest to finish my high school diploma.

    <h4 style="color: rebeccapurple;margin: 10px;">
        Up until college applications, my target career was to be an electrician, but due to my asthma and back
        problems, I decided to follow
        my second choice. Never did I think that this would have been the best decision so far in my life. I have
        finally found a something
        that makes me want to get up and learn everyday.
    </h4>
    <h4 style="color: rebeccapurple;margin: 10px;">
        As I advance in my schooling, the excitment to get out on the job market and to get started on my career has
        truly made everything
        from working full-time, part-time, struggling at school, worth it for me because of the passion I have
        developped for my program of study.
